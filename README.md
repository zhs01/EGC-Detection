# EGC-Detection
You can put the image into "wait_image", run predict.py, and see the EGC lesion diagnosis in "output". Before that, you need to download three weights (https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ilapAUbkbINkpgVt6GS2sA?pwd=jd20 ) that have been pre-trained. And you need to put them in separate folders. Example path: ./EGC_Detection/VGG16-EGC-SAM/checkpoint/sam/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth; ./EGC_Detection/VGG16-EGC-SAM/logs/checkpoint_best.pth; ./EGC_Detection/VGG16-EGC-SAM/Fusion_model/vggnet16/vgg16Net.pth

Some endoscopic images are available at (https://github.com/zhs01/EGC-Detection). Requesters could contact the corresponding author Xueping Huang. (hxuep@mail2.sysu.edu.cn) to gain access.
